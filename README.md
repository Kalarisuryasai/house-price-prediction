In this project, house prices will be predicted given explanatory variables that cover many aspects of residential houses. The goal of this project is to create a regression model that are able to accurately estimate the price of the house given the features.

1.When a customer wants to buy a house,If customer finds the price of house at some given website higher than the price predicted by the model, so he can reject that house
2.This can  maintain the transparency among customers and also the comparison can be made easy through this model.Simple application for predicting the house price
